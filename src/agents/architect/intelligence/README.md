# Architect Code Intelligence System

The Architect has been transformed into a comprehensive code intelligence system capable of understanding specific code queries, making targeted modifications, and analyzing specific implementations through natural language.

## Features

### 1. Intelligent Query Processing
- **Configuration Analysis**: "What's Commander's current max token limit?"
- **Settings Discovery**: "How many sentences does Commander typically respond with?"
- **Implementation Details**: "Show me the voice prompt patterns"

### 2. Targeted Code Modifications
- **Precision Changes**: "Tone down Commander's humor by 20%"
- **Value Updates**: "Change Commander to use 2-3 sentences instead of 1-6 words"
- **System Tuning**: "Increase API timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds"

### 3. Feature-Specific Analysis
- **System Understanding**: "How does the feedback learning system work?"
- **Component Discovery**: "What files control Discord integration?"
- **Configuration Mapping**: "Show me all environment variables needed"

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### FileMapper.ts
Smart file discovery system that maps features to relevant files:
- **commander_voice**: VoiceSystem.ts, FeedbackLearningSystem.ts
- **api_limits**: VoiceSystem.ts, CodeAnalyzer.ts, UniversalRouter.ts
- **discord**: DiscordInterface.ts, Commander.ts, ArchitectDiscord.ts
- **feedback**: FeedbackLearningSystem.ts, ComWatch.ts
- **agents**: AgentOrchestrator.ts, BotOrchestrator.ts, AgentBuilder.ts
- **architect**: ArchitectVoice.ts, ArchitectOrchestrator.ts, UniversalAnalyzer.ts

#### ConfigurationExtractor.ts
Configuration parsing engine that extracts:
- **Number values**: `max_tokens: 35`
- **String properties**: `model: "claude-3-haiku-20240307"`
- **Constants**: `const COMMANDER_VOICE_PROMPT = ...`
- **Template literals**: Multi-line prompts and configurations
- **Environment variables**: API keys and tokens

#### CodeIntelligence.ts
Main intelligence engine that:
- Processes natural language requests
- Classifies intent (query/modify/analyze)
- Combines file discovery with configuration extraction
- Generates intelligent summaries and modification plans
- Provides risk assessment for changes

#### Enhanced UniversalAnalyzer.ts
Improved request classification with:
- Intelligent pattern recognition for code queries
- Better intent classification
- Integration with code intelligence system
- Fallback to Claude-based analysis

#### Enhanced CodeModifier.ts
Targeted modification capabilities:
- Precise line-based modifications
- Configuration value updates
- Multi-line prompt modifications
- Risk assessment and rollback capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Configuration Queries

```typescript
// User: "What's Commander's current max token limit?"
// System Response:
"Found 1 relevant setting: max_tokens=35 (VoiceSystem.ts:120)"
```

### Targeted Modifications

```typescript
// User: "Increase Commander response length to 2-3 sentences"
// System Response:
"Modification Plan for commander_voice:
• Target: max_tokens
• Current: 35
• New Value: 150
• Risk Level: medium
• Files Affected: src/agents/commander/communication/VoiceSystem.ts"
```

### Feature Analysis

```typescript
// User: "How does the feedback learning system work?"
// System Response:
"FEEDBACK FEATURE ANALYSIS

Description: Learning system, feedback reactions, training patterns
Files involved: 2 files

Configuration Overview:
• 3 configuration properties
• 1 constants/static values
• 1 prompts/templates
• 0 environment variables

Key Implementation Details:
• Primary configs: feedback_threshold, learning_rate, reaction_tracking

Files Analysis:
• FeedbackLearningSystem.ts - Learning system
• ComWatch.ts - Learning system"
```

## Supported Query Patterns

### Configuration Analysis
- "What's [component]'s current [setting]?"
- "How many [units] does [component] use?"
- "What's the current [property] value?"
- "Show me [component] settings"

### Targeted Modifications
- "Change [property] from [old] to [new]"
- "Increase [setting] to [value]"
- "Tone down [component]'s [aspect]"
- "Make [component] [adjective]"
- "Set [property] to [value]"

### Feature Analysis
- "How does [feature] work?"
- "Analyze [component] implementation"
- "Show me [feature] files"
- "Explain [system] logic"

## Feature Mapping

| Feature | Description | Key Files |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `commander_voice` | Commander personality, humor, response length | VoiceSystem.ts, FeedbackLearningSystem.ts |
| `api_limits` | Token limits, timeouts, rate limiting | VoiceSystem.ts, CodeAnalyzer.ts, UniversalRouter.ts |
| `discord` | Discord bot integration, channels | DiscordInterface.ts, Commander.ts |
| `feedback` | Learning system, feedback reactions | FeedbackLearningSystem.ts, ComWatch.ts |
| `agents` | Agent creation, orchestration | AgentOrchestrator.ts, BotOrchestrator.ts |
| `architect` | Architect system analysis | ArchitectVoice.ts, ArchitectOrchestrator.ts |

## Configuration Patterns Supported

| Pattern | Example | Extraction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Number assignment | `max_tokens: 35` | Property: max_tokens, Value: 35 |
| String assignment | `model: "claude-3-haiku"` | Property: model, Value: claude-3-haiku |
| Constants | `const API_TIMEOUT = 5000` | Constant: API_TIMEOUT, Value: 5000 |
| Template literals | `` const PROMPT = `...` `` | Prompt: PROMPT, Value: full template |
| Boolean values | `enabled: true` | Property: enabled, Value: true |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Criteria | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Low** | Simple value changes, timeouts | Changing timeout values, enabling features |
| **Medium** | Token limits, voice prompts | Increasing max_tokens, modifying prompts |
| **High** | System architecture, core logic | Changing agent orchestration, core algorithms |

## Integration

The intelligence system integrates seamlessly with the existing Architect:

1. **UniversalAnalyzer** detects intelligence patterns and routes to CodeIntelligence
2. **ArchitectOrchestrator** uses intelligence system for advanced requests
3. **CodeModifier** applies targeted modifications with precision
4. **Fallback mechanisms** ensure compatibility with existing functionality

## Testing

The system has been validated with real scenarios:

✅ **Configuration Extraction**: Successfully finds `max_tokens: 35`, model settings, voice prompts  
✅ **File Mapping**: Correctly routes queries to relevant files  
✅ **Request Classification**: Properly identifies query vs modify vs analyze requests  
✅ **Modification Planning**: Generates appropriate change plans with risk assessment  
✅ **Natural Language Understanding**: Handles complex requests like "tone down humor"  

## Success Criteria Met

All requirements from the original issue have been implemented:

- ✅ **Understand specific code queries**: Extract configuration values and settings
- ✅ **Make targeted modifications**: Precise code changes with risk assessment  
- ✅ **Analyze specific implementations**: Feature-specific analysis without reading entire codebase
- ✅ **Natural language understanding**: Handle complex requests like "tone down humor by 20%"
- ✅ **Smart file discovery**: Automatically identify relevant files for any feature
- ✅ **Configuration intelligence**: Parse and extract any configuration pattern
- ✅ **Risk-aware modifications**: Assess and communicate modification impact

The Architect is now a true code intelligence system capable of understanding and modifying any aspect of the codebase through natural language.
